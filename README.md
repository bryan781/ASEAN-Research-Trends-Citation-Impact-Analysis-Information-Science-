📚 ASEAN Research Trends & Citation Impact Analysis (Information Science)

This project analyzes research trends, citation impact, and collaboration patterns in ASEAN information science journals using quantitative data analysis and text mining techniques. The study leverages Web of Science bibliographic data to examine how ASEAN research output has evolved over time and how international collaboration influences academic impact.

The analysis combines descriptive statistics, TF-IDF topic modeling, and regression analysis to identify emerging research areas, influential ASEAN countries, and key drivers of citation performance.

🔍 Research Objectives

Identify dominant and emerging research topics in ASEAN information science journals

Analyze publication and citation trends over time

Measure research influence across ASEAN countries

Evaluate the impact of international and inter-institutional collaboration on citation counts

Compare linear and non-linear regression models for citation prediction

🧠 Methods & Techniques

Bibliometric analysis

Descriptive statistics (publication year & citation distribution)

TF-IDF analysis on research abstracts

Collaboration analysis (authors & institutions)

Regression models:
